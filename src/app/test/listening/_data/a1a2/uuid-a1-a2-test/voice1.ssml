  Good morning, Mr. Taylor.
  <break time="3s"/>
  I'm fine, thank you. I have a problem with my homework.
  <break time="3s"/>
  I left my English book at home, so I couldnâ€™t finish the reading task.
  <break time="3s"/>
  I tried, but my internet was not working well.
  <break time="3s"/>
  That's great! Is there anything else I should do?
  <break time="3s"/>
  Ok, I will. Thank you, Mr. Taylor.
